py_gee_tools Documentation
==========================

py_gee_tools is a python package developed to help people work with the `Google Earth Engine Python API <https://github.com/google/earthengine-api>`_. The goal of the functions included in this package is to reduce common and sometimes tedious tasks (such as batch ordering of Landsat imagery) to single function calls instead of large scripts.

This code is under development, contributions and suggestions are both encouraged and welcome.
